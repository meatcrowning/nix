  # "More Perfect DOS VGA" ships ONLY a Regular face. Without this, KDE/Qt apps
  # faux-bold (and oblique-shear) it wherever the UI asks for bold/italic text —
  # info-panel labels, selected tabs, section headers, etc. On a pixel font
  # that's already scaled off its 16px grid, the synthetic bold smears and reads
  # as a heavier, slightly larger, different typeface beside the regular glyphs
  # (see kdeglobals — every font role is this family at 11pt, so nothing else
  # explains the size/format mismatch). Pin every request for this family to
  # upright regular and kill synthetic emboldening, so all its text stays
  # uniform. Trade-off: bold emphasis is intentionally dropped for this font.
